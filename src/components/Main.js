                    With a background in graphic design and love for computers, I am eager to transition into a software engineer role. My interest first sparked in high-school, but it was difficult to find an affordable school with a good web development program. With the help of Lambda School and my design skills, Iâ€™m eager to develop functional and clean-looking apps for end-users.
